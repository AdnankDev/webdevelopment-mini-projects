## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is my **digital playground** for experimenting, learning, and building small-scale projects in:

Instead of keeping these projects scattered across folders, this repo serves as a **central hub** where I store and share them — from simple HTML landing pages to interactive apps and backend scripts.
